# Atari 800XL stuff

Notes about the Atari 800XL.

## Booting

 * Boots into BASIC, after checking disk drive + boot info
 * boot + "Option" held down - boots into self-test mode
 * boot + "Start" held down - no BASIC
 * boot + "Start" + "Option" held down - no BASIC, no Cartridge

## Disk Info

(TBD)

## Tape Info

The tape drive does signal decoding.  You can't just hook up audio to
the 800XL and have it "work".  The Atari 410 service manual is available
online and it shouldn't be too hard to turn it into an audio level
adapter.
