# Kenwood TS-140S / TS-680S notes

(TBD)

## Overview

(TBD)

## Common Issues

### Dry Joints

(TBD)

### Finals

(TBD)

### Fan control voltage

 * There is a mod to make the fan come on sooner; but the fan control
   is a small board on the finals board!  So it's quite a pain to get
   to and modify.

## Coil Information (for rewinding coils!)

 * Control Unit L54 (39.6MHz VCO) - 4t, 3t, 3t, 3t ; TBD coil form and ferrite material; TBD value
