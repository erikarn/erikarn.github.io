# Kenwood TS-660

This is a cute little QRP rig that covers 15m, 12m, 10m and 6m.
They're hard to find and they're even harder to find intact and not-broken.

## Overview

## Revisions

 * There's at least two revisions of the control board - one has a single
   connector for the rotary encoder (connector #20); a second one has two
   connectors (#20, #21) with EN1/EN2 swapped (the left/right phase encoder
   output.)

(TBD)

## Common Issues

(TBD)

## PDFs

The service and user manuals should be used together to figure out
what's going on.
