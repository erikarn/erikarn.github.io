TS-790A Satellite Communications Addendum

The information in paragraph 4-9 of the TS-790A Instruction Manual has been
revised to explain the satellite operating procedures.
Satellite communications utilize numerous frequencies and modes in a pre
assigned band plan.  Transponders are used to control the contact.  For
example, part of the band plan of OSCAR 13 utilizes a frequency arrangement
known as mode B.  In this mode, you would transmit to the satellite
(uplink) in the set frequency range of 435.425 -435.575 MHz.  Your signal
will be be processed by the transponder and re-transmitted back to earth
(downlink) in the frequency range of 145.975 - 145.825 MHz.  The TS-790A is
capable of allowing the uplink and downlink frequencies to track
simutaneously by storing the sum of the two frequencies in memory.  Memory
channels 0-2 are programmed by the factory for Fo-12 and OSCAR 10.  The
remaining memories are user programmable.  To operate the TS-790A in the
satellite mode, proceed as follows.
Entering Data
Determine the uplink and downlink frequencies of the satellite you are
tracking. Add the two frequencies together.   The sum can now be placed in
memory as follows:
1.      Press the F key and then the SAT key.
        Note:  This function is inoperative when SUB is selected.
2.      Rotate the Tuning knowb to select the desired satellite memory
channel.
3.      Press the ENT key and then enter the frequency using the numeric
    keypad.  The frequency will be automatically stored after the seventh
digit has been entered.
Recalling Data
The satellite memory channels can be recalled in the following manner.
1.       Press the F key and then the SAT key.
        Note:  This function is inoperative when SUB is selected.
2.      Rotate the TUNING knob to select the desired satellite memory
channel.
3.      Press the SAT key to recall the initial mode setting.

Operating Procedure:
1.      Recall the desired satellite memory channel as described above.
2.      Select the SUB function.
3.      Use the TUNING knob to select the desired downlink (receive)
frequency.
4.      Press the SAT key.  The MAIN display will shift to the correct
uplink         frequency.
5.      Each time you change the SUB frequency, press the SAT key twice in
order         to update the MAIN display.  The first time the SAT key is
pressed, the         transceiver goes out of the satellite mode.  The
second time it is         pressed, the transceiver goes back into the
satellite mode and updates         the MAIN display.   An alternative
method is to press and hold the         SAT key when going into the
satellite mode.  While the key is held, the         TUNING knob can be
rotated and both displays will track simultaneously.
Note:         In step 2, the SUB key was pressed to allow the TUNING knoob
to control         the downlink (receive) frequency.  If the MAIN key is
pressed, the         tuning knob will control the uplink (transmit)
frequency.

  ADAPTING THE KENWOOD TS-790A FOR USE WITH THE PACCOMM MC-NB96 G3RUH MODEM
 12-26-91
 The Kenwood TS-790A makes a wonderful 9600 BPS Packet Radio Transceiver as
it has an excellent front end, powerful transmitter, and 144,440, and 1.2
GHZ coverage. The CFW-455F filter inside is not too narrow despite what you
may have read and coupled with the low noise front end of the rig enables
the G3RUH modem to reliably decode valid data that barely moves the
S-meter.
 The modification discribed below is simple, reversible, and does not
impair normal operation or the appearance of the transceiver. This is a "no
holes" modification as it allows the G3RUH modem to be connected to ACC 4
jack on the rear panel.
 Place the TS-790A upside down on a soft clean surface so as not to mar the
cabinet. Remove the bottom cover to expose the IF. Board. With the front
panel facing you the work area is the upper left quarter of the IF board.
Identify pin 9 of IC8 (MC3357P). There are two of these chips on the IF
board but only the main demodulator IC is in the work area. RX audio to the
modem will be derived from this point. Next locate J31 a two pin connector
near D81 and X2 (10.965 OSC). TX audio from the modem will be supplied to
the hot lead on J31. Note the large aluminum heat sink that spans across
the IF board near the rear of the chassis. A round lug will be mounted on
it near the rear of ACC 4 jack.
 Wire an eight pin din plug. Use shielded cable for TX and RX audio. No
traces on the IF board need to be cut. Pins 3 and 5 of ACC 4 are not
connected to anything as the radio comes from the factory. Make sure the
Din plug fits the jack properly before wiring it. PIN 2 - ground PIN 3 - TX
audio from G3RUH PIN 5 - RX audio to G3RUH PIN 8 - PTT
 Prepare two six inch lenghts of RG-174. Prepare one end of each cable so
that the shield will reach the ground lug mounted on the large aluminum
heat sink. The cables will be routed over the top of the heat sink and will
not be crushed when the bottom cover is reinstalled as there is adequate
clearance.
 Solder the center conductor of one cable to pin 3 on the rear of ACC 4
(verify with ohm meter). Solder the center conductor of the other cable to
pin 5 on the rear of ACC4 (verify with ohm meter). Dress the cable
connected to ACC 4 pin 5 over to IC8 pin 9. Cut to size and solder (be
careful- use minimum heat and thin solder). The exposed shield is discarded
and heat shrink tubing placed over the end to prevent any shorts that would
otherwise occur from having exposed strands of the shield touching
something. Dress the other cable connected to pin 3 of ACC 4 to J31 and cut
to size. Prepare the end in the same manner as the other cable. Solder the
center conductor to pin 2 of J31. This is accomplished by cutting the lead
going to pin 2 about 1/2 inch back, stripping the insulation back 1/8 inch
on the two ends, and then joining the center conductor of the cable going
to pin 3 of ACC 4 and soldering the three exposed ends together. Use heat
shrink tubing to cover the solder joint.
NOTE that the banded end of D81 is not the cathode of the varactor diode !
There is no need to insert any additional capacitance in series with J31
pin 2. The shields are not connected at both ends of the RG-174 cables in
order to prevent ground loops. The Aluminum heat sink was used as ground as
no other ground was available that was close to ACC 4. Your sight may be
better than mind and you may find one.
 Adjust VR-1 on the MC-NB96 board for 75 mv p-p as measured on pin 2 of
J31. This will give a good initial setting for injected transmit audio
level.
 This completes the modification. 9600 BPS Packet can now be enjoyed on
each of the bands installed in your TS-790A. For non-packet operation
either unplug the modem from ACC 4 or turn off power to the modem. For 9600
packet operation unplug the mic and turn the mic gain to minimum.

  TS-790 & 9600 Baud Operation   (Rev 2)
  ----------------------------

These notes were partly taken from James Miller, G3RUH notification for FT736R
and the article of my good friend Sueo Asato, JA6FTL.

These mods are working very well with 9600 bps UO-14 and CBBS operation
currently used at my site.

Please refer to G3RUH's notification for FT736R for more detail.
RX/TX mod suitablity remains same as his notes.

TS-790 ; FM Direct from Discriminator
-------------------------------------
Detected and amplified/buffered FM direct from the receiver discriminator is
available from Pin-9 IC1 (Sub) or IC8 (Main).
I use IC1 (Sub) for reception.

TS-790 ; Direct varactor FM Modulation
--------------------------------------
Inject your TX audio at the cathode side of diode D81 with a 1K ohm register
in series. You can find D81 near Q73 in your IF UNIT diagram.

Misc ;
------
It takes a bit hard work for very small and jungle PCB. Use tiny tools.
Carefully adjust the TX audio level by VR1 of the modem, it's rather low.
You would probablly need some local friend to do this adjustment, asking him
to tell you his TNC's DCD LED stays steady (no flicker).

TS-790 with serial frequency control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                          by Kohjin Yamada, JR1EDE

This note is the summary of our discussion made among W9FMW, JA6FTL andmyself.
The first report has been brought by WB0KSL expressing TS-790 has audio drops
at the frequency change command in it's serial control.
JA6FTL confirmed the data loss at the product detecter on his scope too.
These are as terrible as if we use KCT Tuner in it's serial control option.

Kenwood replied to my inquiry "It is made as so to prevent the noise of PLL,
about 100m sec mute is created".
Kenwood suggests the modification as below but it should be made on user's
responsibility. This should be solved in their next products, I strongly
told them.

JA6FTL and I confirmed that it now works perfectly on FO-20's actual test
and uSATs too with the following modification.


Kenwood suggestion;         (Refer to IF DIAGRAM)
~~~~~~~~~~
You could disable the mute function by following methods, both or item 2 only.

1) Delete D20 or R191 (for SUB audio)
   As far as you would use the rear data port (ACC2), it's *NOT* necessary to
   do this, although you would still have the audio drop at the sound of loud
   speaker. Of cource, you should do this modification when you would hook up
   the audio data from Microphone Plug.

2) Put a jumper between Q4 collector and emitter (for SUB RF Block)
   This modification is a *MUST*.
   You can do this by several ways but the above is most easy.


The following discussion might help you a bit;

Here is additional info. to the modification.
Yes..... Need magnifying glass (I am not farsighted nor shortsighted Hi.)
This modification is to disable the blocking line for IF amp.
Audio muting function remains unchanged, but it is no problem to use rear
data port. (Audio muting circuit consists of D20 and Q12)
1.Put the frontside toward you and remove the bottom cover of 790.
2.remove the 13 screws that fix IF board. Lift over up the board toward you.
3.Q5 and Q4 are located just opposite side of L2 and L3.
  Chip Q5(printed "V11") has 4 solderd legs, and it's located next to R15
  (470 ohm surface mount resistor, printed as "471").
  Q4 is located just beside R15 and has 3 legs.
