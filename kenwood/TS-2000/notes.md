# Kenwood TS-2000

This is where I'm keeping notes about my experiences running a TS-2000
for well, everything it does.

## HF - RX sensitivity issues

There's been a lot of discussion around the TS-2000 RX sensitivity compared to other radios.
Here's at least one piece of research into what may be going on.

And a local copy of the above page:

There are other threads about S-meter calibration being not quite equivalent
to other rigs and tweaking that; that's less interesting/important.

## VHF/UHF - RX sensitivity issues

There's also been a lot of discussion around TS-2000 RX sensitivity on VHF/UHF.

And local copies of the above pages:

 * [ts2000_mod_uu2jj.pdf](ts2000_mod_uu2jj.pdf)

This was apparently fixed in later TS-2000 releases (TODO: which year?)

## Finals replacements

There were issues with the TS-2000 finals.  I should go gather some more
information and post it here.

## Rig control

You can't control TX of the rig through CAT control if you want audio to come
in through the ACC3 jack.  There's a specific PTT line that is "use this audio
input line and mute the MIC" which you have to use.
