Version 1 April 2010   - First release.
Version 2 October 2010 - Example for Nov 2008 corrected.
Version 3 July 2011    - 2011 date code confirmed as B1


None of the following is official Kenwood information, it is my interpretation based on
serial numbers posted to various user groups along with date information and correlation of 
Kenwood's firmware release dates with the serial numbers they apply to.
It is also not specifically TS-2000 it seems to hold good for other Kenwood radios.


Kenwood serial numbers issued during the production life of the TS2000 come in 2 formats.

The original format used from the initial production up until approx August 2008 is as follows:
All numeric - First digit is Year code, add 1998 to get year. If first digit is 0 add 10 to 1998.
Next 2 digits are month code starting with April (begining of Japanese tax year) as 01. 
Months 10,11 & 12 will be Jan, Feb March of the next year so add 1 to the year.

Examples: 
301xxxxx = April 2001
311xxxxx = February 2002
909xxxxx = December 2007
910xxxxx = January 2008
001xxxxx = April 2008
005xxxxx = August 2008


The second format adopted from approx August 2008 is alpha numeric.
The first 2 characters are the year the 3rd is the month starting with 1 in January.
A8 = 2008
A9 = 2009
B0 = 2010
B1 = 2011 and I believe B2 will be 2012 (time will tell if I am correct)
The month runs from 1 Jan to C Dec.

Examples:
A88xxxx = August 2008
A8Bxxxx = November 2008
A91xxxx = January 2009
A9Cxxxx = December 2009
B02xxxx = February 2010
