I received these files from Kenwood.  They list the circuit assemblies that are covered by each TS-2000 Service Manual Supplement, and the relevant TS-2000 serial numbers.

Based on these, you can determine which service manual supplements you need to purchase.

The scan quality is not good, but this is the way I received the files.
