# Kenwood AT-250

This is a collection of notes on the care and feeding of the AT-250 auto tuner.

## Overview

Well, it's an auto-tuner.  It's designed for plug and play operation with
a TS-430S and TS-140S - the DIN connectors on those expose the right remote
band control pins to drive the AT-250.  The TS-680S also does but it obviously
doesn't work for tuning on 6m.

I use it on a TS-440S by shorting the "engage ATU/transmit" pin.


## Common Issues

.. mostly? The relays need replacing.

## PDFs
