# Kenwood TS-450/TS-690

I like this radio but wow the TS-690 I got has shot finals.
This is all TBD as I turn my notes into a doc.

## Overview

(TBD)

## Finals

I've been slowly rebuilding the finals on this unit.
Here are some notes about the inductors.

L3:
 * Primary:  4.6uH
 * Secondary: 1.154, so around 0.740uH each side

L9:
 * secondary - 3.075uH, 0.595uH each side
 * primary - 0.5uH (it's a single turn using soldered pipes)

L6/L7:
 * 1uH choke - 18 turns... ~ 0.7uH on mine

L10/L11:
 * ~ 11uH
