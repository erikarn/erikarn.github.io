# Apple-I 6800 Notes

I may make an apple-i 6800 version, and thus I'm collecting info.

 * TBD - where the 6800 monitor ROM image is
 * 7404 is too fast, it needs to be a 74L04 to meet the timing requirements
   for the phase 2 clock
 * pin 39 on the 6502 socket is floating but it needs to be tied low on the
   6800 with a 10k resistor
